    // Shadowing
    // - You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, and the new

    // - By using 'let', we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable
    //   be immutable after those transformations have been completed.
    // - The other difference between mut and shadowing is that because weâ€™re effectively creating
    //   a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the type of the value
    //   but reuse the same name.

    // 3.2. Data Types

    // Rust is a statically typed language,
